## Overcoming common challenges in Data Science 
Data Science is an exciting and ever-evolving fied, but it also presents a series of challenes that we, as data scientist, must overcome to succed. I want to share some of the most common challenges we face in our daily work and how IÂ´ve addressed them in my projects. I hope these tips help you all!

This project aims to provide practical solutions to these challenges:
1. Data Cleaning: handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data as crucial first step in any data project.
2. Feature Selection: identifying the most relevant features is key to building efficient models and avoiding overfitting.
3. Data Splitting: properly splitting the dataset into training, validations and test sets ensures robust evaluation and model performance.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: training models and evaluating their performance ensures that theu not only work well on training data but also generalize well to new data.
5. Model Deployment and Maintenance: deplying a model in production and ensuring its continuos maintenance, monitoring performance, and updating the model regularly are essential for real-woeld applications.
